In our flow chart, we can see how decisions are handled.

Below, you can see 2 decisions being taken.

## You take take sugar?
The first decision asks the question "Do you take sugar?". At this point, a decision needs to be made.

- If you **do** take sugar, then you need to move to the "Add sugar" step. After adding sugar, you follow the line out of the box to the "Kettle boiled?" decision.
- Otherwise, if you **do not** take sugar, then you move on to the "Kettle boiled?" decision without adding the sugar.

## Has the kettle boiled?
This is the next decision. In this case, the kettle might not yet have boiled so you need to wait.

If not, then you might want to send another Snapchat message while you wait. After you have sent your Snapchat message, you take another look to see if the kettle has boiled or not. If not, you send another message and check again. Once it has boiled, you can move to the "Add boiling water" instruction.

## Adding milk
The final decision follows the exact same principles. In this case, however, it can simply skip the "Add milk" instruction if you don't take milk.

When you are coding, you will come across decision situations all the time. A flow-chart helps you visualize this really nicely.

Writing your algorithm down is really important. Bad programmers often try to write code before they have done this and as a result write messy or badly thought out code.
