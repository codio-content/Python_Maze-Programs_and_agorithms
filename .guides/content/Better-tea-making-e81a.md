Our current tea-making algorithm is rather simple. Let's now take a look at how to make a more sophisticated cup of tea.

This time, we are using a **flow-chart** rather than a list of instructions. You can see the flow chart on the left. You can scroll up and down to see it all.

A flow-chart is a graphical way of showing the steps of the algorithm.

Notice how the steps are much clearer, especially as we have introduced some choices in decision making which mean that the sequence of steps is no longer a straight line. We'll talk about this on the next page.

1. Switch on the kettle.
1. Get a clean cup.
1. Put a tea bag into the cup.
1. Do you take sugar? Yes - add it. No - skip to the next step.
1. Has the kettle boiled? No - wait and do something like Snapchatting a friend. Yes - add the boiling water.
1. Let the tea brew.
1. Remove the tea bag and throw away.
1. Do you take milk? Yes - add milk. No - drink your tea, which is now ready.
