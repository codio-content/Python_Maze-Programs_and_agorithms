## Algorithms
Computer programs are written to solve real world problems. The process of breaking down a problem into a sequence of steps is known as an algorithm.

Our cup of tea process is an example of an algorithm. Once you have got these steps figured out and come up with an algorithm, you are ready to write some code!
