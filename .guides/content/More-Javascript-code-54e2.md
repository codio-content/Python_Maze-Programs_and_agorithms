On the left you can see some Javascript code for our improved tea-making algorithm.

It's not that scary is it?

Don't worry about the details for now, but if you follow it through, you'll see that it is all very logical.

## Functions
You'll notice that we have instructions like

- switchOnKettle()
- getCup()
- addMilk()

The `()` means that `switchOnKettle` and all other instructions with `()` are *functions*. 

A function is nothing more than an instruction that itself consists of one or more steps. We have not shown these here and we will explain these in plenty of detail when we start writing some proper code.

## `if`
You'll also learn about `if` before long. There's no mystery to it, though. The line

```javascript
if (takesSugar == true) 
  addSugar()
```

simply means "if it is true that you take sugar, then add sugar."

## `while`
The `while` insruction is a so-called loop, another important but easy thing we'll cover in detail later.

```javascript
while (kettleBoiled == false) {
  snapChat()
}
```

... means "while (as long as) the kettle has not yet boiled, do some Snapchatting.".

## Have no fear!!!
While these things look mysterious, we'll teach you to get comfortable with them and use a game so you can actually try them out.
